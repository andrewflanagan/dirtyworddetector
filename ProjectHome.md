The idea behind this application is to provide a simple, configurable application that will neatly detect offending words from a dirty word list and strip them out of copy and pasted text. This is designed to facilitate accidental release of content that contains certain words.

Beyond the initial design, it's desired to add additional capability that will mark suspected "dirty words" even if they do not specifically match words in the dirty word list. This advanced feature would assume that if "ford" and "honda" are dirty words then perhaps "toyota" is a dirty word as well.

The second phase of this project would be greatly aided by the work already done by Google in their Sets web application (http://labs.google.com/sets).
